# Additivity Quote Bot

This repository will contain the source code for the Additivity Quote Bot, an automated Reddit bot that:

- scans posts on r/printmything and similar subreddits for 3D-printing quote requests
- checks whether posts meet specific criteria (US delivery + STL/3D file provided)
- retrieves the model file and calculates estimated print volume and pricing
- generates an automated quote
- sends the quote to the requester via Reddit DM

The bot will access the Reddit API using authenticated API calls from this codebase. Code will be added to this repository as development progresses.
